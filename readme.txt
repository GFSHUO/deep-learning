The file test.py: This is the most important document of my program. It is used to read pictures and the training model behind them to produce experimental results. This file needs to be in the python 3.5 environment, tensorflow 1.15.0or2, also to study numpy 1.16, Scikit-image 0.14.2 and so on package. There are also some packages listed in a single case, if the run times error, can be based on the error to add the corresponding package. It is recommended to run with pycharm because I personally think pycharm is more convenient for installing the required package.

The file change.py: This is a picture generator. For the expansion of the number of pictures. You can run directly in pycharm, and if the prompt is missing package, you can add it to pycharm.

The file number.py: This file is also used to expand the picture, the main change is the color, contrast, sharpness and brightness of the picture. Pil packages need to be installed. It can be run directly under pycharm.
